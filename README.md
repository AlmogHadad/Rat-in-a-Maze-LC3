# Rat-in-a-Maze-LC3
solving the rat in a maze problem with LC3(like assembly)

Problem:
  the rat in a maze problem is a problem given as N X N binary matrix of blocks
  where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1].
  A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination.
  The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
 Output: 
   shortest path from [0][0] to [N-1][N-1] or massage that there are not any path.
